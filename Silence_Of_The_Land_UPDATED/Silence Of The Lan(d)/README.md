Created by: Reem Belafkih, Veronica Joseph, Vivian Lam

Description:
You've lived in your peaceful village for years.
Suddenly monsters that lived in the underworld emerged to take over Earth.
You're the only somewhat qualified mage in your town.
It's your job to keep the monsters at bay until the king's knights arrive.
Click the monsters to use your impressive mind abilities to snap the
monsters out of existence before they get to you!
Use WASD to move left and right!
Get enough points before time runs out for a cool present from the king!
Small monsters are 5 points, big monsters are 10 points.
Good luck, now go protect your lan(d)!

Silence of the Lan(d) is a fun interactive fighting game for all ages.
It works on motor skills and isn't graphic, so it's perfect for children.
With a thrilling story and smooth mechanics, Silence of the Lan(d) is for
everyone.

Installation:
This game needs Pygame installed! Open the game as a project on Pycharm and install Pygame through the
Python Packages menu. When Pygame is installed, open the main.py file and press run.

Usage:
To move, the only controls you need are A (to move left) and D (to move
right)! You can kill monsters by left or right-clicking on them. You can skip the story through clicking the screen.

Mechanics:
One core part of the code is the timer. We used the timer in order to
spawn big and small enemies at specific intervals. The timer was also used
for the typewriter effect seen on the loading screen and the final screens
to blit each of the messages in an orderly manner. The timer is an integral part of the program 
and allows us to introduce a challenging stream of enemies for the player. We would check what time 
the timer was currently at and use a boolean to start movement of enemies at that exact second.
